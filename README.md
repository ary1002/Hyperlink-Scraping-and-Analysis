# Hyperlink Scraping & Analysis
This project utilizes web crawling techniques to extract valuable links from the CSE Department website. The extracted data is then processed using regular expressions to ensure the dataset's accuracy and relevance. The final step involves seamless integration with Google Sheets for organized storage and collaborative exploration of the extracted links.

## Features

- **Web Crawling:** Implemented a Python web crawler using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to navigate and extract links from the department's website.

- **Regular Expression Filtering:** Applied regular expressions to filter out unwanted links, ensuring a refined dataset for analysis.

- **Google Sheets Integration:** Integrated the project with Google Sheets using `gspread` for efficient storage and collaborative exploration of the extracted links.
